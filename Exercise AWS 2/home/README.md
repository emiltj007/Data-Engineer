# Project: Data Warehouse

## Introduction
A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database and want to move their processes and data onto the cloud. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

As their data engineer, I am tasked with building an ETL pipeline that extracts their data from S3, stages them in Redshift, and transforms data into a set of dimensional tables for their analytics team to continue finding insights into what songs their users are listening to.

## Project Datasets

Following are the 2 datasets along with metadata file provided by Sparkify and is stored in S3 bucket situated in the us-west-2 region.

Song data: s3://udacity-dend/song_data
Log data: s3://udacity-dend/log_data
Log metadata: s3://udacity-dend/log_json_path.json


### Song Dataset
The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset(opens in a new tab). Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are file paths to two files in this dataset.

song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json

And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.

{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}


### Log Dataset
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator(opens in a new tab) based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate app activity logs from an imaginary music streaming app based on configuration settings.

The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are file paths to two files in this dataset.

log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json

And below is an example of what the data in a log file, 2018-11-12-events.json, looks like.

### Log JSON Metadata
The log_json_path.json file is used when loading JSON data into Redshift. It specifies the structure of the JSON data so that Redshift can properly parse and load it into the staging tables.


## Data modelling for Song Play Analysis
Using the song and event datasets,  an optimised star schema is created for queries on song play analysis. This includes the following tables.

### Fact Table
#### songplays
records in event data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong :
sp_songplay_id, sp_start_time, sp_user_id, sp_level, sp_song_id, sp_artist_id, sp_session_id, sp_location, sp_user_agent
### Dimension Tables
#### users 
users in the app :
u_user_id, u_first_name, u_last_name, u_gender, u_level
#### songs 
songs in music database :
s_song_id, s_title, s_artist_id, s_year, s_duration
#### artists 
artists in music database :
a_artist_id, a_name, a_location, a_latitude, a_longitude
#### time 
timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units :
t_start_time, t_hour, t_day, t_week, t_month, t_year, t_weekday


## Project Architecture 

The project template includes following files:

**create_table.py**  create the fact and dimension tables for the star schema in Redshift.

**etl.py** load data from S3 into staging tables on Redshift and then process that data into analytics tables on Redshift.

**sql_queries.py** define SQL statements, which will be imported into the two other files above.


### Create Table Schemas
1. Design schemas for your fact and dimension tables
2. Write a SQL CREATE statement for each of these tables in sql_queries.py
3. Complete the logic in create_tables.py to connect to the database and create these tables
4. Write SQL DROP statements to drop tables in the beginning of create_tables.py if the tables already exist. This way, you can run create_tables.py whenever you want to reset your database and test your ETL pipeline.
5. Launch a redshift cluster and create an IAM role that has read access to S3.
6. Add redshift database and IAM role info to dwh.cfg.
7. Test by running create_tables.py and checking the table schemas in your redshift database. You can use Query Editor in the AWS Redshift console for this.

### Build ETL Pipeline
1. Implement the logic in etl.py to load data from S3 to staging tables on Redshift.
2. Implement the logic in etl.py to load data from staging tables to analytics tables on Redshift.
3. Test by running etl.py after running create_tables.py and running the analytic queries on your Redshift database to compare your results with the expected results.
4. Delete your redshift cluster when finished.


## Analaytic queries

**Count of each file**

select COUNT(1) from stg_events --8056

select COUNT(1) from stg_songs --14896

select COUNT(1) from fact_songplay --1144

select COUNT(1) from dim_user --105

select COUNT(1) from dim_song --14896

select COUNT(1) from dim_artist --10025

select COUNT(1) from dim_time  --810


**Top 5 days with highest number of users**

select top 5 t_start_time as date_of_songplay,count(sp_user_id) as Number_of_users
from fact_songplay fs
join dim_time dt on fs.sp_start_time=dt.t_start_time
group by t_start_time
order by count(sp_user_id) desc

**Most played top 5 songs**

select top 5 s_title as song,count(sp_song_id) as Number_of_songplay
from fact_songplay fs
join dim_song ds on fs.sp_song_id=ds.s_song_id
group by s_title
